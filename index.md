Hi there, I live and paint here in East Devon, just minutes from the coast. The paintings on sale here all began in the landscape with the weather and the elements, and that initial emotive response triggers the creative process.

Paint is layered thinly over lines of charcoal and then layers of paint are built up with inks, pigments and glazes adding texture and interest. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed painting them. Do use the QR code, if you wish to see paintings currently available for sale with prices. 

Please add Â£100 for a commission. 

Painting and printing courses also available for both adults and children.
